# DVT `.build` configuration File Generator

This VS Code extension allows for the generation of a `.build` file, which is required for the [DVT extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=amiq.dvt), by using a single command.

## Features

Automatic detection of `run.log` files within the current `tb`'s `build` directory, making it easy to select the desired files. Additionally, you can also manually select a `run.log` file.

## Usage

To generate a `.build` file, simply open the command palette (<kbd>cmd/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and search for `Generate .build file...`.

## Thanks

This extension was inspired by the impressive Eclipse extension created by Alon Margalit (margal@apple.com).
